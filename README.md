# Advanced Databases
This is a project developed for the ECE NTUA course "Advanced Topics in Databases" during the year of 2021-2022. 

## Project Overview
This project leverages Apache Spark to perform analytical queries on a subset of the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movie information, genres, and user ratings. The analysis covers data transformation and the execution of various queries using both RDD API and Spark SQL.

## Datasets
The dataset we used for the analysis is a subset of the [Full MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). The version we leveraged can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). The exact Dataset we used can be downloaded [here](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/courses/atds/movie_data.tar.gz) and it includes the following CSV files:

**- movies.csv :** Movie details. The key fields in this dataset are:
  - _id_: The unique identifier for each movie (integer).
  - _title_: The title of the movie (string). Titles may contain commas, so care must be taken when parsing this field.
  - _description_: A textual summary or synopsis of the movie (string).
  - _release_date_: The date the movie was released (timestamp in ISO format).
  - _duration_: The length of the movie in minutes (float).
  - _budget_: The production budget of the movie in US dollars (float). If unknown, the field may be empty or zero.
  - _revenue_: The total revenue generated by the movie in US dollars (float). If unknown, the field may be empty or zero.
  - _popularity_: A numeric representation of the popularity of the movie (float).

**- movies.csv :** Movie genres associated with each movie
**- movies.csv :** User ratings of movies
